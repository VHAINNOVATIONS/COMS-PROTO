	


For many cancer patients, having blood drawn is routine. Many patients and their families become sophisticated about these "labs," and request copies of their reports. Others rely on their physicians and nurses to explain results. A general knowledge of the purpose of commonly ordered laboratory tests may be helpful to patients and their families, but the significance of laboratory test results should always be discussed with your physician.

Oncology Services acknowledges with thanks the assistance of UCLA’s department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Elizabeth Wagar, MD, director of Clinical Laboratories, in the preparation of this information

NORMAL VALUES OR REFERENCE RANGES
Reports of laboratory test results compare individual results with a Reference Range or Normal Laboratory Values. Reference Ranges are developed by clinical laboratories based upon the statistical data for 95% of each laboratory’s patient population. Thus, no two laboratories will have identical reference ranges.
In comparing laboratory test results with reference Ranges, remember that in reviewing test results, your physician is aware of the effect of any medications that you might be taking on test results. Also, in comparing results with Reference Ranges, particularly in instances of a borderline or marginal variation from the range, patients should know that subtle factors such as position or condition of the patient (sitting v. lying down; fasting v. after a meal) the time of day, even weather and climate can affect results.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
In reviewing laboratory test results, patients should bear in mind:

    No single test is 100% accurate for specificity, sensitivity or predictive value.
    Any particular laboratory result may be inaccurate, for a variety of reasons.
    The degree of abnormality and the significance of the abnormality are proportional. That is, marginal variations likely have less significance than wide variations.
    Multiple test abnormalities are more likely significant that single test abnormalities.
    Test results, when possible, should be compared over time, preferably with results from the same laboratory. When possible, comparison with the patient’s test results prior to illness may be helpful.
